href=\"/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/important-institutions-national-institution-reserve-bank-of-india\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong> </a>announced the <strong>\u2018RBI Retail Direct\u2019 Scheme.</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>In February 2021 RBI <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/direct-access-to-g-sec-market-for-retail-investors-rbi\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>proposed to allow retail investors to open gilt accounts</strong></a> with the central bank to invest in <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/rbi-to-buy-g-secs\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Government securities (G-secs)</strong></a> directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>About:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Under the scheme, <strong>retail investors (individuals) will have the facility to open and maintain the \u2018Retail Direct Gilt Account\u2019</strong> (RDG Account) with the RBI.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Retail Investor</strong> is a non-professional investor who buys and sells securities or funds that contain a basket of securities such as mutual funds and <strong><a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bharat-bond-exchange-traded-fund\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)</a>.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A Gilt Account</strong> can be compared with a bank account, except that the <strong>account is debited or credited with treasury bills or government securities instead of money.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>RDG accounts can be opened through an <strong>online portal</strong> provided for the purpose of the scheme.</li>\n<li>The online portal will give registered users access to primary <strong>issuance of G-secs and access to Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching system (NDS-OM).</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The RBI introduced the <strong>NDS-OM in August 2005.</strong> It is an <strong>electronic, screen based, anonymous, order driven trading system</strong> for dealing in G-secs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It is a <strong>one-stop solution to facilitate investment in G-secs</strong> by individual investors. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>RBI seeks to <strong>democratize the ownership of government debt securities</strong> beyond banks and managers of pooled resources such as mutual funds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Current G-Sec Market:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The G-sec market is <strong>dominated by institutional investors</strong> which are large market actors such as banks, mutual funds and insurance companies. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>These <strong>entities trade in lot sizes of Rs 5 crore or more.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>So, there is <strong>no liquidity in the secondary market for small investors</strong> who would want to trade in smaller lot sizes. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The <strong>primary market</strong> is where securities are created, while the <strong>secondary market</strong> is where those securities are traded by investors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There is <strong>no easy way for them to exit their investments.</strong> Thus, currently, direct G-secs trading is not popular among retail investors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Significance:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Improved Ease of Access:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>It will make the process of G-sec <strong>trading smoother for small investors</strong> therefore it will <strong>raise retail participation in G-secs</strong> and will <strong>improve ease of access.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Facilitate Government Borrowings:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>This measure together with relaxation in mandatory Hold To Maturity (securities that are purchased to be owned until maturity) provisions <strong>will facilitate smooth completion of the government borrowing programme in 2021-22.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Financialise Domestic Savings:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Allowing direct retail participation in the G-Sec market will <strong>promote financialisation of a vast pool of domestic savings</strong> and could be a game-changer in India\u2019s investment market.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Other Measures Taken to Increase Retail Investment in Government Securities:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Introduction of non-competitive bidding</strong> in primary auctions.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Non-competitive bidding</strong> means the bidder would be able to participate in the auctions of dated government securities without having to quote the yield or price in the bid.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Stock exchanges to act as aggregators</strong> and facilitators of retail bids.</li>\n<li><strong>Allowing a specific retail segment</strong> in the secondary market.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"border-bg\">\n<p><strong>Government Security</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>A G-Sec is a <strong>tradable instrument</strong> issued by the Central Government or the State Governments.</li>\n<li>It <strong>acknowledges the Government\u2019s debt obligation.</strong> Such securities are <strong>short term</strong> (usually called treasury bills, <strong>with original maturities of less than one year- presently issued in three tenors, namely, 91 day, 182 day and 364 day)</strong> or <strong>long term</strong> (usually called Government bonds or dated securities with <strong>original maturity of one year or more).</strong></li>\n<li>In India, the <strong>Central Government issues both treasury bills and bonds or dated securities</strong> while

A huge amount of <strong>heat is generated</strong> in the process, <strong>pushing the water molecules further up.</strong></li>\n<li>As they move to <strong>temperatures below zero</strong>, droplets change into small ice crystals. As they continue upwards, they gather mass, until they <strong>become so heavy that they start descending.</strong></li>\n<li>It leads to a system where smaller ice crystals move upwards while larger ones come down. The <strong>resulting collisions trigger release of electrons</strong>, in a process very <strong>similar to the generation of electric sparks.</strong> The moving free electrons cause more collisions and more electrons leading to a chain reaction.</li>\n<li>The process results in a situation in which the <strong>top layer of the cloud gets positively charged</strong> while the <strong>middle layer is negatively charged.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1626169119_pasted%20image 0 (9).png\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><img caption=\"false\" class=\"content-img\" src=\"https://www.drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1626169119_pasted image 0 (9).png\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"450\"/></strong></a></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>In little time, a huge current, of the order of lakhs to millions of amperes, starts to flow between the layers.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>It <strong>produces heat</strong>, leading to the heating of the air column between the two layers of cloud.</li>\n<li>It is because of this heat that the <strong>air column looks red during lightning.</strong></li>\n<li>The heated air column expands and produces shock waves that result in<strong> thunder sounds.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>Strikes Earth\u2019s Surface:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The <strong>Earth is a good conductor of electricity.</strong> While electrically neutral, it is relatively positively charged compared to the middle layer of the cloud.

part of British India</strong> in 1881.</li>\n<li>The effort to bring scattered Naga tribes together resulted in the <strong>formation of the Naga Club in 1918.</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The club aroused a sense of<strong> Naga nationalism.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The club<strong> metamorphosed into the Naga National Council (NNC) in 1946.</strong></li>\n<li>Under the leadership of Angami Zapu Phizo, the <strong>NNC declared Nagaland as an independent State on 14<sup>th</sup> August, 1947,</strong> and conducted a \u201creferendum\u201d in May 1951 to claim that 99.9% of the Nagas supported a \u201csovereign Nagaland\u201d.</li>\n<li>Nagaland <strong>achieved statehood in December 1963.</strong> Nagaland was formed out of the Naga Hills district of Assam and the then North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) province (now Arunachal Pradesh).</li>\n<li>In<strong> 1975,</strong> under the <strong>Shillong Accord,</strong> some factions of NNC and NFG (Naga Federal Government) agreed to give up arms.</li>\n<li><strong>A group of about 140 members led by Thuingaleng Muivah,</strong> who was at that time in China, refused to accept the Shillong Accord and<strong> formed the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN) in 1980.</strong></li>\n<li>In 1988, the <strong>NSCN split into NSCN (IM) and NSCN (K)</strong> after a violent clash.</li>\n<li>While the NNC began to fade away, and Phizo died in London in 1991, the NSCN (IM) came to be seen as the \u201cmother of all insurgencies\u201d in the region.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Demands of Naga Groups:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The key demand of Naga groups has been a <strong>Greater Nagalim</strong> (sovereign statehood) i.e redrawing of boundaries to bring all Naga-inhabited areas in the Northeast under one administrative umbrella.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>It includes

Shillong in which the NNC leadership agreed to give up arms.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>However, several leaders refused to accept the agreement, which led to the split of NNC.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Ceasefire Agreement (1997):</strong> The NSCN-IM signed a ceasefire agreement with the government to stop attacks on Indian armed forces. In return, the government would stop all counter-insurgency offensive operations.</li>\n<li><strong>Framework Agreement (2015):</strong> In this agreement, the Government of India recognised the unique history, culture and position of the Nagas and their sentiments and aspirations.</li>\n<li>Recently, the State government decided to prepare the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/register-of-indigenous-inhabitants-of-nagaland-1#:~:text=There%20are%20nineteen%20major%20Naga,%2C%20Tankhuls%2C%20Yamchumgar%20and%20Zeeliang.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Register of Indigenous Inhabitants of Nagaland</strong></a> but later due to pressure from various fractions, the decision was put on hold.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Issues:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The 2015 agreement apparently made the peace process inclusive but it created suspicion about the central government <strong>exploiting divisions within the Nagas on tribal and geopolitical lines.</strong></li>\n<li>The issue of integration of contiguous Naga-inhabited areas of Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh in view of the demand for territorial unification of \u2018Greater Nagalim\u2019 <strong>will trigger violent clashes in the different affected states.</strong></li>\n<li>Another major hindrance to the peace process in Nagaland is the <strong>existence of more than one organisation,</strong> each claiming to be representative of the Nagas.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Way Forward</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>The Centre <strong>must negotiate with all the factions and groups of the Insurgents</strong> to have a long-lasting peace. Further, their<strong> cultural, historical and territorial extent</strong> must be taken into consideration.</li>\n<li>Any arrangement to be worked out <strong>should lead to social and political harmony, economic prosperity and protection of the life and property</strong> of all tribes and citizens of the states.</li>\n<li>Another way of dealing with the issue can be <strong>maximum decentralisation of powers to the tribal heads and minimum centralisation at the apex level,</strong> which should mainly work towards facilitating governance and undertaking large development projects.</li>\n<li><strong>Greater autonomy for the Naga inhabited areas in these states can be provided</strong> which would encompass separate budget allocations for the Naga inhabited areas with regard to their culture and development issues.</li>\n<li>Moreover, the Centre must keep in mind that most of the armed insurgencies across the world do not end in either total victory or comprehensive defeat, but in <strong>a grey zone called \u2018compromise\u2019.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/panel-on-naga-issue-to-meet-today/article35228462.ece\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Source: TH</strong></a></p>\n</div>",

law started in 1986, through judgement of Supreme Court in <strong>Mr. Kulwal v/s Jaipur Municipal Corporation</strong> case, in which it directed that freedom of speech and expression provided under<strong> Article 19</strong> of the Constitution clearly implies Right to Information, as without information the freedom of speech and expression cannot be fully used by the citizens</li>\n<li>It has been implemented in order to see that the <strong>Indian citizens are enabled to exercise their rights to ask some pertinent questions</strong> to the Government and different public utility service providers in a practical way.</li>\n<li>The RTI Act replaced the <strong>Freedom of Information Act 2002.</strong></li>\n<li>The objective of this act was to <strong>help the citizens avail of quicker services from the government agencies</strong> since the act enables them to ask questions like why a particular application or an official proceeding gets delayed.</li>\n<li>Mainly the act aims at achieving a <strong>corruption-free India.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Information that can be sought</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:

<strong>governance of the people, by the people and for the people.</strong> In order to achieve the third paradigm, the state needs to start acknowledging the importance of an informed public and the role that it plays in the country\u2019s development as a nation. In this context, <strong>underlying issues related to RTI Act should be resolved,</strong> so that it can serve the information needs of society.</li>\n<li>The <strong>role of information commissions is crucial especially during<a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/comprehensive-action-plan-for-covid-19\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"> Covid-19</a></strong> to ensure that people can obtain information on healthcare facilities, social security programs and delivery of essential goods and services meant for those in distress.</li>\n<li>By its 2019 order, the apex court had passed a slew of directions to the Central and State governments to fill vacancies across Central and State Information Commissions in a transparent and timely manner.</li>\n<li><strong>Urgent digitization of records and proper record management</strong> is important as lack of remote access to records in the lockdown has been widely cited as the reason for not being able to conduct hearings of appeals and complaints by commissions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-asks-centre-states-to-file-compliance-report-on-its-2019-verdict-to-fill-vacancies-at-cic-sics/article35186195.ece\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Source: TH</strong></a></p>\n</div>",

href=\"/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-international-institution/world-health-organization-who\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong></a> has declared China as \u201cmalaria-free\u201d.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>It is a result of a seven decade-long, <strong>multi-pronged health strategy</strong> that was able to entirely eliminate indigenous cases for four straight years.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>About Malaria Free Status:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Certification Process:</strong> Certification of malaria elimination is the official recognition by WHO of a country\u2019s malaria-free status.\r\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>WHO grants the certification when a country has demonstrated with rigorous, credible evidence that the <strong>chain of indigenous malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes has been interrupted nationwide for at least the past three consecutive years.</strong></li>\n<li>A country must also demonstrate the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of transmission.</li>\n<li>The final decision on awarding a malaria-free certification rests with the <strong>WHO Director-General,</strong> based on a recommendation by the independent<strong> Malaria Elimination Certification Panel (MECP).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Western Pacific Region:</strong> China is the first country in the WHO Western Pacific Region to be awarded a malaria-free certification in more than 3 decades. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Other Countries:</strong> In Western Pacific region the countries that have achieved this status include Australia (1981), Singapore (1982) and Brunei Darussalam (1987).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Global Status:</strong> Globally, 40 countries and territories have been granted a malaria-free certification from WHO \u2013 including, most recently, El Salvador (2021), Algeria (2019), Argentina (2019), Paraguay (2018) and Uzbekistan (2018).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Disease Burden (Global):</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>According to the <strong><a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/world-malaria-report-2020-who\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">World Malaria Report, 2020</a>,</strong> the <strong>number of malaria cases worldwide in 2019 was around 229 million,</strong> with 4,09,000 lives lost to the mosquito-borne disease.</li>\n<li><strong>Majority of cases were reported in Africa,</strong> while <strong>India and Southeast Asia recorded a significant drop. </strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Cases in India fell from approximately 20 million to 6 million.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>India is the only high endemic country which has reported a decline</strong> of 17.6% in 2019 as compared to 2018.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>China's Malaria Strategy:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Started in 1950s:</strong> The efforts began in the early 1950s, a time when China was reporting millions of cases annually, starting with a multi-pronged approach of<strong> providing anti-malarial medicines while targeting mosquito breeding grounds and using insecticide spraying.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The 523 Project:</strong> It <strong>led to the discovery of artemisinin</strong> in the 1970s.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Artemisinin is the core compound of artemisinin-based combination therapies, the <strong>most effective antimalarial drugs</strong> available today.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Insecticide-treated Nets:</strong> In the 1980s, China began using insecticide-treated nets widely, distributing 2.4 million nets by 1988.</li>\n<li><strong>1-3-7 Strategy:</strong> The strategy refers to:<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>A <strong>one-day deadline to report a malaria diagnosis,</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Confirming a case and determining the spread by the third day,</strong> and</li>\n<li><strong>Measures taken to stop the spread by the seventh day,</strong> along with continued surveillance in high-risk areas.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Global Fund:</strong> With assistance from the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/global-fund-for-aids-tb-and-malaria\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria</strong></a> starting in

America as well as Asia.</li>\n<li>The parasites <strong>spread through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.</strong></li>\n<li>After entering the human body, parasites initially multiply within the liver cells and then <strong>attack the Red Blood Cells (RBCs)</strong> resulting in their rupture.</li>\n<li>There are <strong>5 parasite species</strong> that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species \u2013 Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax \u2013 pose the greatest threat.</li>\n<li><strong>Symptoms of malaria</strong> include fever and flu-like illness, including shaking chills, headache, muscle aches, and tiredness.</li>\n<li>It is <strong>preventable as well as curable.</strong></li>\n<li>The <a

malaria elimination efforts were initiated in 2015 and were intensified after the launch of the <strong>National Framework for Malaria Elimination (NFME)</strong> in 2016 by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>NFME is in line with WHO\u2019s Global Technical Strategy for Malaria, 2016-2030, which guides the WHO<strong> Global Malaria

through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise.</li>\n<li>There are many<strong> types of cooperatives</strong> such as <strong>Consumer</strong> Cooperative Society, <strong>Producer</strong> Cooperative Society, <strong>Credit</strong> Cooperative Society, <strong>Housing</strong> Cooperative Society and <strong>Marketing</strong> Cooperative

<strong>first started in Europe</strong> and the British Government replicated it in India to<strong> mitigate the miseries of the poor farmers, particularly harassment by moneylenders.</strong></li>\n<li>The term Cooperative Societies came into existence when the<strong> farmers of Pune and Ahmednagar (Maharashtra) spearheaded an agitation against the money lenders who were charging exorbitant rates of interest.</strong></li>\n<li>British government came forward and passed three acts- <strong>the Deccan Agricultural Relief Act (1879), the Land Improvement Loan Act

News</h3>\n<p>The<a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/dipp-renamed-as-dpiit\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)</strong> </a>has issued orders appointing an advisory committee for its <strong>Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) project </strong>that is<strong> aimed at curbing \u201cdigital monopolies\u201d.</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>This is in the direction of making<a href=\"/to-the-points/paper3/e-commerce-in-india\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> e-commerce</strong> </a><strong>processes open source,</strong> thus creating a platform that can be<strong> utilised by all online retailers.</strong></li>\n<li>Earlier, the <strong>Ministry of Consumer Affairs</strong> released draft <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/proposal-to-ban-flash-sales-on-e-commerce-sites\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>e-commerce rules</strong></a> for consumer protection which seek to bring changes to how e-commerce marketplaces, including Amazon and Flipkart, operate after small businesses complained that they misuse market dominance and deep-discounting to gain an unfair advantage.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>About:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The ONDC aims at promoting open networks developed on open-sourced methodology, using open specifications and open network protocols, independent on any specific platform.</li>\n<li>The project to integrate e-commerce platforms through a network based on open-source technology has been tasked to the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/world-accreditation-day-2020-qci\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Quality Council of India.</strong></a></li>\n<li>Implementation of ONDC, which is expected to be on the<strong> lines of <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/upi-transactions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unified Payments Interface (UPI)</a></strong> could bring various operational aspects put in place by e-commerce platforms to the same level.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Various operational aspects include onboarding of sellers, vendor discovery, price discovery and product cataloguing etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On ONDC, buyers and sellers may transact irrespective of the fact that they are attached to one specific e-commerce portal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Significance:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>If the ONDC gets implemented and mandated, it would mean that <strong>all e-commerce companies</strong> will have to operate <strong>using the same processes</strong> (like Android Based Mobile Devices).</li>\n<li>This could give a huge booster shot to smaller online retailers and new entrants.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>If mandated, this<strong> could be problematic for larger e-commerce companies, which have their own processes and technology deployed</strong> for these segments of operations.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>ONDC is expected to<strong> digitise the entire value chain, standardise operations, promote inclusion</strong> of suppliers, derive <strong>efficiency in logistics</strong> and enhance<strong> value for consumers.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Meaning of Open-Source:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Making a software or a process open-source means that the <strong>code or the steps of that process is made available freely</strong> for others to use, redistribute and modify it. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>For example, while the operating system of <strong>Apple\u2019s iPhones (iOS) is closed source,</strong> meaning it cannot be legally modified or reverse engineered,</li>\n<li><strong>Google\u2019s Android operating system is open-source,</strong> and therefore it is possible by smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung, Xiaomi, OnePlus, etc to modify it for their hardware.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Government Initiatives Regarding e-Commerce in India:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:

News</h3>\n<p>Recently, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) pushed back against a plan by the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/opec\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) Plus</strong></a> group to <strong>extend the global pact to cut oil production beyond April 2022.</strong></p>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>The Output Pact &amp; Fluctuating Oil Price:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The OPEC+ group of countries had, in April 2020, entered into a <strong>two-year agreement (Output Pact), which entailed steep cuts in crude production to deal with a sharp fall in the price of oil</strong> as a result of the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/comprehensive-action-plan-for-covid-19\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Covid-19 pandemic.</strong></a> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The price of <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/impact-of-crude-oil-price-hike\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Brent crude</strong></a> hit an <strong>18-year low of under USD 20 per barrel in April 2020</strong> as economic activity around the world crashed as countries dealt with the pandemic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In <strong>November 2020, the prices started rising</strong> and in <strong>July 2021, they were USD 76.5 per barrel</strong> mainly due to the steady<strong> rollout of <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/covid-19-vaccination\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vaccination programmes</a> around the world.</strong></li>\n<li>OPEC+, however, <strong>maintained lower levels of production</strong> despite crude oil prices reaching pre-Covid levels, with Saudi Arabia, notably, announcing a further cut in production of 1 million barrels per day for the February-to-April period, which <strong>helped boost rising prices even further.</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The OPEC+ group ran into <strong>sharp criticism from developing economies, including India, for deliberately maintaining low supply levels to raise prices.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In April, OPEC+ agreed to gradually increase crude production, including a <strong>phased end to Saudi Arabia\u2019s 1 million barrel per day cut in production by July.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>UAE\u2019s Objection:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>UAE agreed that there was a need to increase crude oil production from August 2021, but did not agree to a condition by the <strong>OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) </strong>that the <strong>two-year production agreement be extended by six months.</strong></li>\n<li>The UAE\u2019s key objection to the existing agreement is the <strong>reference output used to calculate the total production apportioned to each oil-exporting country.</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The <strong>baseline production level reference</strong> used in the current agreement was <strong>not reflective of the UAE\u2019s production capacity</strong> and, therefore, led to the UAE being apportioned a lower share of total production of crude oil.</li>\n<li>UAE would be open to extending the agreement if baseline production levels were reviewed to be fair to all parties.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Impact of OPEC+ conflict on India:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Delayed Relief:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>If the UAE and other OPEC+ nations do not reach an agreement to increase production in August, <strong>expected relief in the form of lower crude oil prices could be delayed. </strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>High Domestic Prices:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>India is currently <strong>facing record-high prices of petrol and diesel.</strong> High crude prices have led to <strong>Indian oil marketing companies hiking the price of petrol by about 19.3%</strong> and that of diesel by about 21% since the beginning of 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Slow Recovery:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The high price of crude oil was<strong> slowing down the economic recovery of developing economies post the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/covid-19-now-pandemic-who\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pandemic</a>.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Inflation:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The high prices might also increase the <a

<strong>OECD-G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)</strong> have joined a new <strong>two-pillar plan</strong> to reform international taxation rules.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>The two-pillar plan - <strong>inclusive framework tax deal on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)-</strong> seeks to <strong>reform international tax rules</strong> and ensure that multinational enterprises pay their fair share wherever they operate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>About:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The signatories of the plan amounted to <strong>130 countries and jurisdictions,</strong> representing more than <strong>90% of global <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/gdp-growth\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GDP</a>.</strong></li>\n<li>The new framework seeks to <strong>address the tax challenges</strong> arising from the <strong>digitalisation of economies.</strong></li>\n<li>It also seeks to <strong>address concerns over cross-border profit shifting</strong> and bring in subject-to-tax rule to stop <strong>treaty shopping.</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Treaty shopping is an attempt by a person to indirectly access the benefits of a tax treaty between two countries without being a resident of any of those.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Two Pillar Plan:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:

respect to the largest MNEs, including digital companies.</li>\n<li>It would re-allocate some taxing rights over MNEs from their home countries to the markets where they have business activities and earn profits, regardless of whether firms have a physical presence there.</li>\n<li>According to OECD, more than USD 100 billion of profit are expected to be reallocated to market jurisdictions each year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Pillar Two:</strong> It is about <strong>minimum tax and subject-to-tax rules</strong> (All sources of income liable to tax without taking account of tax allowances).<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>It seeks to put a minimum standard tax rate among countries through a <strong>global minimum corporate tax rate,</strong> currently<strong> proposed at 15%.</strong></li>\n<li>This is <strong>expected to generate an additional USD 150 billion</strong> in tax revenues.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Significance:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>It will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere.</li>\n<li>The two-pillar package will provide much-needed support to governments needing to raise necessary revenues to repair their budgets and their balance sheets while investing in essential public services, infrastructure and the measures necessary to help optimise the strength and the quality of the post-Covid recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>India\u2019s Stand:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>India will have to roll back the <a

Google, Amazon and Facebook when the global tax regime is implemented.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>It is aimed at taxing foreign companies which have a significant local client base in India but are billing them through their offshore units, effectively escaping the country\u2019s tax system.</li>\n<li>The levy at 6% has been in force since 2016 on payment exceeding Rs 1 lakh a year to a non-resident service provider for online advertisements.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>India <strong>favours a wider application of the law</strong> to ensure that the<strong> country won\u2019t collect less</strong> under the proposed framework <strong>than it gets through the equalisation levy.</strong></li>\n<li>India is in favour of a consensus solution which is simple to implement and simple to comply with.</li>\n<li>The solution should result in <strong>allocation of meaningful and sustainable revenue</strong> to market jurisdictions, particularly for developing and emerging economies.</li>\n<li>The Two Pillar Plan <strong>justifies India\u2019s stand</strong> for a <strong>greater share of profits for the markets</strong> and consideration of <strong>demand side factors in profit allocation.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"border-bg\">\n<p><strong>Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:

minimize the corporation tax</strong> that is payable overall, by either making tax profits \u2018disappear\u2019 or<strong> shift profits to low tax jurisdictions where there is little or no genuine activity.</strong></li>\n<li>In general BEPS strategies are<strong> not illegal; rather they take advantage of different tax rules operating in different jurisdictions.</strong></li>\n<li>BEPS is of <strong>major significance</strong> for developing countries due to their heavy reliance on corporate income tax, particularly from multinational enterprises (MNEs).</li>\n<li>The BEPS initiative is

It is <strong>also known as a Polar light.</strong></li>\n<li>They commonly occur at high northern and southern latitudes, less frequent at mid-latitudes, and seldom seen near the equator.</li>\n<li>While <strong>usually a milky greenish color</strong>, auroras can also show red, blue, violet, pink, and white. These colors appear in a variety of continuously changing shapes.</li>\n<li>Auroras are <strong>not just something that happens on Earth.</strong> If a planet has an atmosphere and magnetic field, they probably have auroras.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Cause of Auroras on Earth:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Auroras are caused <strong>when charged particles ejected from the Sun\u2019s surface - called the solar wind - enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.</strong></li>\n<li>The typical aurora is <strong>caused by collisions between charged particles from space with the oxygen and nitrogen in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere.</strong></li>\n<li>The electrons - which come from the<a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/1-d-simulation-code-to-study-earth-s-magnetosphere\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> Earth\u2019s magnetosphere</strong></a>, the region of space controlled by Earth\u2019s magnetic field - transfer their energy to the oxygen and nitrogen atoms and molecules, making them \u201cexcited\u201d.</li>\n<li>When a large number of electrons come from the magnetosphere to bombard the atmosphere, the<strong> oxygen and nitrogen can emit enough light for the eye to detect, giving us beautiful auroral displays.</strong></li>\n<li>In the <strong>northern part of our globe, </strong>the<strong> polar lights are called aurora borealis or Northern Lights</strong>, and are seen from the US (Alaska), Canada, Iceland, Greenland, Norway, Sweden and Finland.</li>\n<li>In the <strong>south, they are called aurora australis or southern lights</strong>, and are visible from high latitudes in Antarctica, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand and Australia.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Discrete Auroras of Mars:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Unlike auroras on Earth, which are seen only near the north and south poles, <strong>Discrete Auroras (DA) on Mars are seen all around</strong> the planet at night time.</li>\n<li>These DAs are traced out where <strong>energetic particles excite the atmosphere</strong> after being funneled down by a patchy network of crustal <strong>magnetic fields that originate from minerals</strong> on the surface of Mars.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Martian Auroras are Different:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Unlike Earth, which has a strong magnetic field, the <strong>Martian magnetic field has largely died out.</strong> This is because the molten iron at the interior of the planet - which produces magnetism - has cooled.</li>\n<li>However, the <strong>Martian crust</strong>, which hardened billions of years ago when the magnetic field still existed, <strong>retains some magnetism.</strong></li>\n<li>So, in contrast with Earth, which acts like one single bar magnet, <strong>magnetism on Mars is unevenly distributed</strong>, with fields strewn across the planet and differing in direction and strength.</li>\n<li>These <strong>disjointed fields channel the solar wind to different parts of the Martian atmosphere</strong>, creating \u201cdiscrete\u201d auroras over the entire surface of the planet as charged particles interact with atoms and molecules in the sky\u2013 as they do on Earth.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Significance:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Studying Martian auroras is important for scientists, for it <strong>can offer clues as to why the Red Planet lost its magnetic field and thick atmosphere</strong>\u2013 among the essential requirements for sustaining life.</li>\n<li>With the information gathered during the UAE\u2019s Mars mission, scientists will have<strong> a better understanding of the climate dynamics of different layers of Mars\u2019 atmosphere.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"border-bg\">\n<p><strong>Other Mars Missions</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/nasa-s-mars-2020-mission\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>NASA's Mars 2020 Mission</strong></a> <strong>(Perseverance Rover)</strong>: The mission is designed to better understand the geology of Mars and seek signs of ancient life.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/tianwen-1-china-s-mars-mission-1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tianwen-1: China's Mars Mission</a>:</strong> It was launched in 2019 to conduct scientific investigations into the planet\u2019s soil, geological structure, environment, atmosphere and water.</li>\n<li><strong>India\u2019s <a href=\"/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/indian-space-research-organisation-isro\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM)</a> or Mangalyaan:</strong> It was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Andhra Pradesh by Indian Space Research Organisation in November 2013.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/uae-hope-orbiter-discrete-auroras-mars-7390298/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Source: IE</strong></a></p>\n</div>",

2021.</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>The bill once finalised will need the Cabinet approval and assent from both the houses of Parliament to become a Law.</li>\n<li>A <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/government-clarifies-on-the-anti-human-trafficking-bill\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>previous draft</strong></a> had been introduced in 2018 but that <strong>could not be introduced in Rajya Sabha</strong> amid stiff opposition from Parliamentarians and experts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>Criticism to the Old Bill:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>According to the <a href=\"/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-international-institution/united-nations-1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>United Nations</strong></a>\u2019 human rights experts, it was <strong>not in accordance with the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/human-rights-day-2\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">international human rights laws.</a></strong></li>\n<li>The Bill seemed to<strong> combine sex work and migration with trafficking.</strong></li>\n<li>The Bill was criticised for <strong>addressing trafficking through a criminal law perspective instead of complementing it</strong> with a human-rights based and victim-centred approach.</li>\n<li>It was also criticised for promoting <strong>\u201crescue raids\u201d</strong> by the police as well as <strong>institutionalisation of victims in the name of rehabilitation.</strong></li>\n<li>It was pointed out that<strong> certain vague provisions would lead to blanket criminalisation of activities</strong> that do not necessarily relate to trafficking.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Provisions in the New Bill:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>It <strong>extends to all citizens inside as well as outside</strong> India,<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Persons on any ship or aircraft registered in India</strong> wherever it may be or carrying Indian citizens wherever they may be,</li>\n<li><strong>A foreign national or a stateless person</strong> who has his or her residence in India at the time of commission of offence under this Act, and</li>\n<li>The law will apply to every offence of<strong> trafficking in persons with cross-border implications.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Victims Covered:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>It <strong>extends beyond the protection of women and children as victims</strong> <strong>to now include transgenders as well as any person</strong> who may be a victim of trafficking.</li>\n<li>It also does away with the provision that a victim necessarily needs to be transported from one place to another to be defined as a victim.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Defines \u2018Exploitation\u2019:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation including pornography, any act of physical exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to

used for trafficking can now be forfeited</strong> with provisions set in place, similar to that of the <strong><a

felicitate around 54,000 taxpayers to mark the competition of 4 years of <strong>Goods and Services Tax (GST).</strong></p>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>Achievements of GST:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Automated Indirect Tax Ecosystem:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The<strong> introduction of <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/e-way-bills-during-lockdown\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">e-way bills</a> coupled with the crackdown on fake invoicing</strong> has helped in bringing in a substantial portion of GST revenues, which were either being evaded or under-reported.</li>\n<li>E-invoicing system <strong>would also usher the taxpayers into a fully automated compliance regime</strong> wherein the computation of tax liabilities and matching of input tax credit would become very simple.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Simplification of Compliance:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Various initiatives viz. <strong>linking the customs portal with GST portal</strong> for credit availability on imports, making available proper means for matching input tax credit, increased automation of the refund procedure to seamless operation of the Invoice Registry Portal, helped simplify tax compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Functioning of GST Council:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The GST Council made corrections to law, issued clarifications on complex issues, rationalized GST rates and introduced relaxations for dealing with the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/covid-19-now-pandemic-who\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Covid-19 pandemic</strong></a>, which establishes that the GST Council structure has been very functional and agile.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Example to the World:</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>India has served as an example to the world by<strong> successfully implementing one of the most complex tax transformation projects</strong> for the country.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Fiscal Federalism:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>This issue <strong>became controversial when GST collections fell because of the pandemic.</strong></li>\n<li>Because <strong>GST entailed a bigger surrender of taxation powers for the states \u2013</strong> states do not levy direct taxes or customs duties \u2013 <strong>a <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/gst-compensation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">guaranteed revenue growth of 14%</a> for a period of five years was offered</strong> to them by the centre to get them to agree.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Issues Highlighted by the 15<sup>th</sup> Finance Commission:</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/15th-finance-commission-recommendations-resource-allocation\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>15<sup>th</sup> Finance Commission</strong></a> has highlighted several areas of concern in the GST regime relating to <strong>multiplicity of tax rates, shortfall in GST collections vis-\u00e0-vis the forecast, high volatility in GST collections,</strong> inconsistency in filing of returns, dependence of States on the compensation from Centre and so on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Large Businesses vs Small Businesses:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The fundamental principles on which the GST law was built viz. seamless flow of input credits and ease of compliance <strong>has been impaired by IT glitches.</strong></li>\n<li>Indirect taxes, unlike direct taxes such as income tax, <strong>do not differentiate between the rich and the poor</strong> and therefore put a bigger burden on the latter.</li>\n<li>Further, <strong>small and medium businesses are still grappling to adapt to the tech-enabled regime.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Suggestions:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>With<strong> oil prices sky-rocketing across the country,</strong> the policymakers <strong>need to contemplate the inclusion of petroleum and related products within the GST</strong> net.</li>\n<li>It is vital to finally<strong> constitute the GST Appellate Tribunal</strong> as it is obvious that all taxpayers do not have the finances or means to approach the High Court for every practical difficulty faced.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlining of <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/gst-council-and-national-anti-profiteering-authority\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">anti-profiteering measures</a> and simplification of compliance procedures</strong> also needs to be revisited to ensure that the cost efficiency and reduction in prices envisaged under GST law finally reaches the common man.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Goods And Services Tax</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>About:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The GST is<strong> a value-added tax levied on most goods and services sold for domestic consumption.</strong></li>\n<li>The GST is <strong>paid by consumers,</strong> but it is<strong> remitted to the government by the businesses selling the goods and services.</strong></li>\n<li>GST, which <strong>subsumed almost all domestic indirect taxes</strong> (petroleum, alcoholic beverages and stamp duty are the major exceptions) under one head, is perhaps the biggest tax reform in the history of independent India. It was launched into operation on the midnight of 1<sup>st</sup> July 2017.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Features of GST:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Applicable on Supply Side:</strong> GST is applicable on<strong> \u2018supply\u2019</strong> of goods or services as against the old concept on the manufacture of goods or on sale of goods or on provision of services.</li>\n<li><strong>Destination based Taxation:</strong> GST is based on the principle of destination-based consumption taxation as against the principle of origin-based taxation.</li>\n<li><strong>Dual GST:</strong> It is a dual GST with the Centre and the States simultaneously levying tax on a common base. The GST to be levied by the Centre is called <strong>Central GST (CGST)</strong> and that to be levied by the States is called<strong> State GST (SGST).</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Import of goods or services would be treated as inter-state supplies and would be subject to <strong>Integrated Goods &amp; Services Tax (IGST)</strong> in addition to the applicable customs duties.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GST rates to be mutually decided:</strong> CGST, SGST &amp; IGST are levied at rates to be mutually agreed upon by the Centre and the States. The rates are notified on the recommendation of the <strong>GST Council.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Multiple Rates:</strong> GST is levied at four rates viz. <strong>5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.</strong> The schedule or list of items that would fall under these multiple slabs are worked out by the GST council.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>This is aside from the tax on gold that is kept at 3% and rough precious and semi-precious stones that are placed at a special rate of 0.25% under GST.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>GST Council:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>It is <strong>a constitutional body (Article 279A)</strong> for making recommendations to the Union and State Government on issues related to GST.</li>\n<li>The GST Council is <strong>chaired by the Union Finance Minister</strong> and other members are the Union State Minister of Revenue or Finance and Ministers in-charge of Finance or Taxation of all the States.</li>\n<li>It is <strong>considered as a federal body</strong> where both the centre and the states get due representation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reforms brought about by GST:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Creation of a common national market:</strong> By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax.</li>\n<li><strong>Mitigation of cascading effect:</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The GST that a merchant pays to procure goods or services (i.e. on inputs) can be set off later against the tax applicable on supply of final goods and services. The set off tax is called <strong>input tax credit.</strong></li>\n<li>The GST thus avoids cascading effect or tax on tax which increases the tax burden on the end consumer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reduction in Tax burden:</strong> From the consumers\u2019 point of view, the biggest advantage is in terms of reduction in the overall tax burden on goods.</li>\n<li><strong>Making Indian products more competitive:</strong> Introduction of GST is making Indian products more competitive in the domestic and international markets owing to the full neutralization of input taxes across the value chain of production.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Way Forward</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>The law is <strong>still a \u2018work-in-progress\u2019</strong> and the process of evolution, in such a complex journey, cannot be eliminated. The Government should <strong>continue to take measures to deliver on its promise of a \u2018Good &amp; Simple Tax\u2019</strong> in the times to come.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1731542\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Source: PIB</strong></a></p>\n</div>",

the US State Department, the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/comprehensive-action-plan-for-covid-19\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Covid-19 pandemic</strong></a> has resulted in an <strong>increase in vulnerability to human trafficking </strong>and<strong> interrupted existing anti-traffic efforts.</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>Human trafficking, also called trafficking in persons,<strong> form of modern-day slavery</strong> involving the illegal transport of individuals by force or deception for the<strong> purpose of labour, sexual exploitation, or activities in which others benefit financially.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>Findings of the Report:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>While India did not meet the minimum standards to eliminate trafficking, the government was <strong>making significant efforts,</strong> although these were inadequate, especially when it came to <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/bonded-labour-in-india\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>bonded labour.</strong></a></li>\n<li>Chinese government engaged in <strong>widespread forced labour,</strong> including through the continued mass arbitrary detention of more than one million <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/uighur-muslims\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Uyghurs</strong></a>, <strong>ethnic Kazakhs, ethnic Kyrgyz, and other Muslims.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reasons for Increased Trafficking:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The concurrence of the <strong>increased number of individuals at risk, traffickers\u2019 ability to capitalise on competing crises,</strong> and the<strong> diversion of resources to pandemic response efforts</strong> has resulted in an ideal environment for human trafficking to flourish and evolve.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Categorisation of Countries:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The categorisation is based not on the magnitude of a country\u2019s trafficking problem but <strong>on efforts to meet minimum standards</strong> for the elimination of human trafficking.</li>\n<li>The countries are designated on the <strong>three-tier system:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Tier 1 countries</strong> are those countries whose governments <strong>fully comply with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act</strong> (TVPA - US\u2019s law on human trafficking) minimum standards.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>USA, UK, Australia, Bahrain and South Korea are some of the countries in tier 1.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Tier 2 countries</strong> are those countries whose governments<strong> do not fully comply with TVPA's minimum standards</strong> but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Tier 2 watchlist countries</strong> are those where the absolute number of victims of severe forms of trafficking is significant or is significantly increasing.</li>\n<li><strong>India</strong> is placed in <strong>Tier 2 category.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Tier 3 countries</strong> whose governments <strong>do not fully comply</strong> with the minimum standards and are not making significant efforts to do so.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Afghanistan, Burma, China, Cuba, Eritrea, North Korea, Iran, Russia, South Sudan, Syria and Turkmenistan are under this tier.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There are also a few <strong>\"Special Cases\"</strong> such as <strong>Yemen,</strong> where the civil conflict and humanitarian crisis make gaining information

with the issue (e.g.<strong> The Punjab Prevention of Human Smuggling Act, 2012).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"border-bg\">\n<p><strong>Other Steps Taken by India</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>Anti-Trafficking Nodal Cell</strong> was set up in the<strong> Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)</strong> in 2006 to act as a focal point for

The<strong> Ministry of Home Affairs</strong> under a Comprehensive <strong>Scheme \u2018Strengthening Law Enforcement Response in India against Trafficking in Persons\u2019 (2010)</strong> has released fund for establishment of AHTU for many districts of the country.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The primary role of an <strong>Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU)</strong> is law enforcement and liaising with other concerned agencies for care &amp; rehabilitation of victims.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>UN Convention:</strong> India has ratified <strong>(in 2011) United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime (UNCTOC)</strong> which among others has a Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and

India and Bangladesh</strong> for Prevention of Human Trafficking in Women and Children, Rescue, Recovery, Repatriation and Re-integration of Victims of Trafficking was signed in June, 2015.</li>\n<li><strong>Judicial Colloquium:</strong> These are held at the High court level. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The aim is to sensitize the judicial officers about the various issues concerning human trafficking and to ensure speedy court process.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Capacity Building:</strong> Various <strong>Training of Trainers (TOT) workshops on \u2018Combating Trafficking in Human Beings\u2019</strong> for Police officers and for Prosecutors at Regional level, State level and District level have been organized by the government throughout the country.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Way Forward</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>There is a need to step up <strong>technical assistance and strengthen cooperation,</strong> to support all countries to protect victims and bring criminals to justice.</li>\n<li>The <strong>capacity building</strong> of the <strong>Police along with that of the NGOs</strong> is necessary to tackle the menace of human trafficking.</li>\n<li>There is a need to<strong> ensure proper data sharing,</strong> internally in an administration or between agencies like the police or the NGOs, or

variable regionally since at least 2006 but<strong> by 2016</strong> open defecation had <strong>decreased in all states,</strong> with the largest drops seen in <strong>Himachal Pradesh and Haryana.</strong></li>\n<li>Progress in curbing open defecation in <strong>sub-Saharan Africa was slow.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>On SDG 6:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:

style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>It refers to the practise whereby people go out in fields, bushes, forests, open bodies of water, or other open spaces rather than using the toilet to defecate.</li>\n<li>It poses a serious threat to the health of children in India.</li>\n<li>It exposes women to the danger of physical attacks and encounters such as snake bites.</li>\n<li>Poor

The winds blow <strong>from west to east in jet streams</strong> but the flow often<strong> shifts to the north and south.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This <strong>strong change in ocean temperature from the west to the east</strong> is the reason for the<strong> heat dome (HD).</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The<strong> western Pacific ocean\u2019s temperatures</strong> have increased in the past few decades and are<strong> relatively more than the temperature in the eastern Pacific.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>HD also prevents clouds from forming, allowing for more radiation from the sun to hit the ground.</li>\n<li>A heat dome is<strong> effectively what it sounds like</strong> - an area of high pressure that parks over a region like a lid on a pot, trapping heat. They are more likely to form during<a href=\"/to-the-points/paper1/el-nino-and-la-nina\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> La Ni\u00f1a</strong></a> years like 2021, when waters are cool in the eastern Pacific and warm in the western Pacific.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1625217033_image1.jpg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img caption=\"false\" class=\"content-img\" height=\"454\" src=\"https://www.drishtiias.com/images/uploads/1625217033_image1.jpg\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" width=\"628\"/></a></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>Heat Wave:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>A heat wave is <strong>a period of abnormally high temperatures,</strong> more than the normal maximum temperature that lasts for more than two days.</li>\n<li>Heat waves <strong>typically occur between March and June,</strong> and in some rare cases even extend till July.</li>\n<li>Heat waves can occur with or without high humidity and have the potential to cover a large area,<strong> \u201cexposing a high number of people to hazardous heat.\u201d</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Impact on Humans (Wet-bulb temperature):</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>As long as the body is producing sweat, which is then able to evaporate quickly, the <strong>body will be able to remain cool even under high temperatures.</strong></li>\n<li>Wet-bulb temperature (WBT) is <strong>a limit that considers heat and humidity beyond which humans can not tolerate high temperatures.</strong></li>\n<li>Temperatures beyond WBT<strong> can cause heat related illnesses including heat stroke, heat exhaustion, sunburn and heat rashes.</strong> Sometimes these can prove fatal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Effects of Heat Dome:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Those living without an air conditioner see the temperatures of their homes rising to unbearably high, leading to sudden fatalities.</li>\n<li>The trapping of heat <strong>can also damage crops, dry out vegetation and result in droughts.</strong></li>\n<li>The sweltering heat wave will also<strong> lead to rise in energy demand,</strong> especially electricity, leading to pushing up rates.</li>\n<li>The heat domes <strong>can also act as fuel to wildfires,</strong> which destroys a lot of land area in the US every year.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Climate change and heat domes:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The weather scientists have been highlighting the effects of climate change on more extreme heat waves.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>According to a 2017 NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) survey, average US temperatures have increased since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>However, Scientists are usually wary of linking climate change to any contemporary event mainly because of the difficulty in completely ruling out the possibility of the event having been caused by some other reason, or being a result of natural variability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-heat-dome-causing-record-high-temperatures-in-parts-of-north-america-7384994/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Source: IE</strong></a></p>\n</div>",

<a href=\"/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/supreme-court-of-india\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Supreme Court of India</strong></a> has recently held that <a href=\"/to-the-points/Paper2/issues-related-to-persons-with-disability\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>persons with physical disabilities</strong></a> have the right to <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/supreme-court-directive-on-quota-in-promotions\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>reservation in promotions</strong> </a>also.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>A disabled particular person can avail the advantage of <a href=\"/to-the-points/Paper2/reservation-in-india\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>reservation</strong></a> for promotion even when she or he was recruited within the common class or developed the incapacity after gaining employment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>About the Case:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The case was based on a claim under the <strong>Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995.</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>This Act has been<strong> replaced with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The<strong> Kerala Administrative Tribunal rejected the plea</strong> of applicant stating that the <strong>rule of Recruitment in the State of Kerala, General Rules and other orders</strong> issued by the Government <strong>under Section 32 of the 1995 Act did not provide for any reservation in promotions.</strong></li>\n<li>The <strong>Kerala High Court set aside the decision</strong> of the Kerala Administrative Tribunal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Importance of Judgement:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The<strong> 1995 Act recognizes the right to reservation in promotion.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Identification of posts for reservation</strong> as per Section 32 of the 1995 Act is a <strong>prerequisite for appointment;</strong> but appointment cannot be frustrated by refusing to identify posts.</li>\n<li>The<strong> absence of provision for reservation in the recruitment rules will not defeat the right of a PwD</strong> as such right flows from the legislation.</li>\n<li>Reservation to promotion <strong>can be given to a PwD even if the person was not originally appointed in the PwD quota.</strong></li>\n<li>Further, the <strong>responsibility to provide equal opportunities</strong> to disabled persons <strong>does not end with giving them reservation at the time of recruitment.</strong></li>\n<li>Legislative mandate<strong> provides for equal opportunity for career progression, including promotion.</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Thus, it would be negation of the legislative mandate if promotion is denied to PwD and such reservation is confined to the initial stage of induction in service.</li>\n<li>This would in fact result in stagnation of the disabled in a consequential frustration.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Right of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>It fulfills the obligations to the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/status-on-implementation-of-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-act-2016\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>United National Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD)</strong></a>, to which <strong>India is a signatory.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Disability has been defined</strong> based on an evolving and dynamic concept.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The<strong> types of disabilities have been increased from 7 to 21.</strong></li>\n<li>The Act added mental illness, autism, spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, chronic neurological conditions, speech and language disability, thalassemia, hemophilia, sickle cell disease, multiple disabilities including deaf blindness, acid attack victims and Parkinson\u2019s disease which were largely ignored in earlier act.</li>\n<li>In addition, the Government has been authorized to notify any other category of specified disability.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It <strong>increases the quantum of reservation</strong> for people suffering from disabilities from 3% to 4% in government jobs and from 3% to 5% in higher education institutes.</li>\n<li>Every child with benchmark disability between the age group of 6 and 18 years shall have the <strong>right to free education.</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Government funded educational institutions as well as the government recognized institutions will have to provide inclusive education.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stress has been given to ensure <strong>accessibility in public buildings</strong> in a prescribed time frame along with the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/accessible-india-campaign\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Accessible India Campaign.</strong></a></li>\n<li>The <strong>Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities</strong> and the<strong> State Commissioners</strong> will act as <strong>regulatory bodies and Grievance Redressal agencies,</strong> monitoring implementation of the Act.</li>\n<li>A<strong> separate National and State Fund</strong> will be created to provide financial support to the persons with disabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Constitutional Framework for Disabled in India:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Article 41 of the Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP)</strong> states that State shall make effective provision for securing right to work, to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, within the limits of its economic capacity and development.</li>\n<li><strong>State Subject:</strong> The subject of <strong>\u2018relief of the disabled and unemployable\u2019</strong> is specified in the <a

more than seven decades after it came into effect as the <strong>Bombay Prohibition Act.</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>The <strong>prohibition on manufacture, sale and consumption of liquor in the state vide the Gujarat Prohibition Act, 1949</strong>, has been challenged on grounds of 'manifest arbitrariness' and violation of 'right to privacy'.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>Background:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Bombay Abkari Act, 1878:</strong> The first hint at the prohibition of liquor was through the Bombay Abkari Act, 1878 (in the Province of Bombay). <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>This Act dealt with levying of duties on intoxicants, among other things and aspects of prohibition via amendments made in 1939 and 1947.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949:</strong> There were \u201cmany lacuna\u201d in the Bombay Abkari Act, 1878, from the point of view of the government\u2019s decision to enforce prohibition. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>This led to the birth of <strong>Bombay Prohibition Act, 1949.</strong></li>\n<li>The <strong><a href=\"/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-national-institutions/supreme-court-of-india\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Supreme Court</a> (SC) upheld the Act</strong> broadly barring a few sections in 1951 in the judgment of <em><strong>State of Bombay and another versus FN Balsara.</strong></em></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Gujarat Prohibition Act, 1949:</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Following the <strong>reorganisation of Bombay province into the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat in 1960</strong>, there was continued amendment and<strong> liberalisation in the state of Maharashtra</strong>, especially in 1963.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The ground for the liberalisation of the law was to check the business of illicit liquor.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gujarat<strong> adopted the prohibition policy in 1960</strong> and subsequently chose to enforce it with greater rigidity, but also made processes easier for foreign tourists and visitors to get liquor permits.</li>\n<li>In 2011, the Act was <strong>renamed as Gujarat Prohibition Act.</strong> In 2017, the <strong>Gujarat Prohibition (Amendment) Act</strong> was passed with provision of up to ten years jail for manufacturing, purchase, sale and transportation of liquor in the dry state.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Grounds for Challenging the Act:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>The right of privacy:</strong> Any invasion by the state in an individual\u2019s right to choice of food and beverage amounts to an unreasonable restriction and destroys the individual\u2019s decisional and bodily autonomy. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/privacy-judgement-and-the-aftermath\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Right to privacy</strong></a> has been held as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court in several judgments since 2017.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Ground of Manifest Arbitrariness:</strong> It has been especially highlighted while <strong>challenging sections pertaining to grant of health permits and temporary permits to out-of-state tourists.</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The petitioner says that there are no intelligible differences in the classes thus being created by the state on who gets to drink and who does not and <strong>violates the <a href=\"/to-the-points/Paper2/fundamental-rights-part-1#:~:text=Equality%20of%20Opportunity%20in%20Public,appointment%20to%20any%20public%20office.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Right to Equality</a> under Article 14 of the Constitution.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Counter Argument:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Aggravate the Sense of Violence:</strong> Various research and studies have shown that alcohol tends to aggravate the sense of violence. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Most of the domestic violence crimes against women and children are committed behind closed doors.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Constitutional Obligation of State:</strong> Challenging the law, is an \u201cattack on the constitutional obligation of the primary duty of the State as the guardian of the population to protect the health and lives of its people\u201d.</li>\n<li><strong>National Prohibition</strong> was advocated by <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/mahatma-gandhi-jayanti\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Mahatma Gandhi</strong></a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Arguments Against Prohibition:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Loss of Revenue:</strong> Tax revenues from alcohol is a major part of any government\u2019s revenues. These enable the government to finance several public welfare schemes. Absence of these revenues severely impacts state\u2019s ability to run public welfare programmes.</li>\n<li><strong>Burden on Judiciary:</strong> Bihar introduced complete prohibition in April 2016.

The countries are assessed in <strong>seven categories:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Strategy and doctrine</li>\n<li>Governance, command and control</li>\n<li>Core cyber-intelligence capability</li>\n<li>Cyber empowerment and dependence</li>\n<li>Cyber security and resilience</li>\n<li>Global leadership in cyberspace affairs</li>\n<li>Offensive cyber capability</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Key Observations:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The report has <strong>divided the 15 states into three tiers of cyber power:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>First Tier:</strong> States with<strong> world-leading strengths across all the categories</strong> in the methodology. The<strong> United States of America</strong> is the only country in this tier.</li>\n<li><strong>Second Tier:</strong> States that have <strong>world-leading strengths in some of the categories.</strong> Australia, Canada, China, France, Israel, Russia and the United Kingdom are in this tier.</li>\n<li><strong>Third Tier:</strong> States that have strengths or <strong>potential strengths in some of the categories but significant weaknesses in others. India,</strong> Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, North Korea and Vietnam are in this tier.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This report provides confirmation of the <strong>likely durability of US digital-industrial superiority</strong> for at least the next ten years. There can be<strong> two reasons</strong> for this.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>In advanced cyber technologies and their exploitation for economic and military power, the <strong>US is still ahead of China.</strong></li>\n<li>Since 2018, the US and several of its leading allies have agreed to <strong>restrict China\u2019s access to some Western technologies.</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>By doing so, these countries have endorsed a partial decoupling of the West and China that could potentially impede the latter\u2019s ability to develop its own advanced technology.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>India Specific Observations:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Despite the <strong>geo-strategic instability of its region</strong> and a keen awareness of the cyber threat it faces, India has made only <strong>\u201cmodest progress\u201d in developing its policy and doctrine</strong> for cyberspace security.</li>\n<li>India has <strong>some cyber-intelligence and offensive cyber capabilities</strong> but they are<strong> regionally focused, principally on Pakistan.</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>However, the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/galwan-valley-clash\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>military confrontation with China</strong></a> in the disputed Ladakh border area in June 2020, followed by a sharp increase in Chinese activity against Indian networks, has heightened Indian concerns about cyber security, not least in systems supplied by China.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>India is currently aiming to compensate for its weaknesses by building <strong>new capability with the help of key international partners \u2013</strong> including the US, the UK and France \u2013 and by looking to concerted international action to develop norms of restraint.</li>\n<li>India\u2019s approach towards<strong> institutional reform of cyber governance </strong>has been<strong> \u201cslow and incremental\u201d,</strong> with key coordinating authorities for cyber security in the civil and military domains established only as late as 2018 and 2019 respectively.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The key authorities work closely with the main cyber-intelligence agency, the <strong>National Technical Research Organisation.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The strengths of the Indian digital economy include a <strong>vibrant start-up culture and a very large talent pool.</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The private sector has moved more quickly than the government in promoting national cyber security.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The country is <strong>active and visible in cyber diplomacy</strong> but <strong>has not been among the leaders on global norms,</strong> preferring instead to make productive practical arrangements with key states.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"border-bg\">\n<p><strong>National Technical Research Organisation</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO), established in 2004, is under the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/india-s-nsa-visit-to-afghanistan\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>National Security Advisor</strong></a> in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and focuses on intelligence gathering.</li>\n<li>The agency specializes in <strong>multiple disciplines,</strong> which include remote sensing, data gathering and processing, cyber security, geospatial information gathering, cryptology, strategic hardware and software development and strategic monitoring.</li>\n<li>The <strong>National Critical information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC),</strong> an agency under the control of <strong>National Technical Research Organisation,</strong> aims to monitor, intercept and assess threats to critical infrastructure and other vital installations from intelligence gathered using sensors and platforms which include satellites, underwater buoys, drones, VSAT-terminal locators and fiber-optic cable nodal tap points.</li>\n<li>NTRO has the same <strong>\u201cnorms of conduct\u201d as the Intelligence Bureau (IB)</strong> and the <strong>Research and Analysis Wing (R&amp;AW).</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h3>Way Forward</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>According to the report, India is a third-tier cyber power whose best chance of progressing to the second tier is by <strong>harnessing its great digital-industrial potential</strong> and <strong>adopting a whole-of-society approach</strong> to improving its cyber security.</li>\n<li>Also, the key is <strong>\u201cpolitical will\u201d and \u201chow India organises its intelligence agencies.\u201d</strong> One of the <strong>\u201cleapfrog opportunities\u201d</strong> for governments to be more effective in cyberpower is \u201chow they

News</h3>\n<p>Recently, Chinese Military has raised <strong>new militia units</strong> comprising local Tibetan youth for <strong>high-altitude warfare.</strong></p>\n<p><a

Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>About:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>The new units named <strong>Mimang Cheton</strong> are presently undergoing training, and are to be <strong>deployed mostly in upper Himalayan ranges</strong>, both in the <strong>eastern and western sectors of the India-China border.</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>They are being <strong>trained for a variety of tasks</strong>, including using <strong>high-tech equipment</strong> such as <strong>drones</strong> on the one hand, as well as <strong>mules and horses</strong> to reach regions in the Himalayan range that can\u2019t be accessed by modern means.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>They have been<strong> raised near Eastern Ladakh</strong>, the site of the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/galwan-valley-clash\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>recent border tensions</strong></a> along the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/india-china-conflict#:~:text=Demarcation%20Line%3A%20The%20Line%20of,UN)%20after%20the%20Kashmir%20War.\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Line of Actual Control (LAC)</strong></a>, as well as near its borders with <strong>Sikkim and Bhutan.</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The<strong> LAC</strong> is the demarcation that separates Indian-controlled territory from Chinese-controlled territory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Trained units have already been deployed along various locations in the Chumbi valley and at Rutog in Tibet, near the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/face-off-between-india-and-china\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Pangong Tso (lake)</strong></a> in eastern Ladakh.</li>\n<li>The deployment of the new Mimang Cheton units mirrors India\u2019s elite and decades-old <strong><a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/special-frontier-force-vikas-battalion\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Special Frontier Force (SFF)</a>.</strong> <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Just like the SFF which relies on the knowledge of Tibetans, the Mimang Cheton also <strong>relies on the local knowledge of Tibetans as well as locals' resistance to High Altitude Sickness, a problem in alpine warfare.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Objectives:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>High Altitude WarFare:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>The new units will be used for <strong>high-altitude warfare as well for surveillance.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Socio Cultural Aspect:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>A new feature of the units is that upon completion of training, they are <strong>being blessed by Buddhist monks in Tibet</strong>, which is being interpreted as a sign of greater socio-cultural outreach from the PLA to ethnic Tibetans.</li>\n<li>This is possibly a new strategy of the PLA to <strong>get some mileage in the Tibet region.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Recent Chinese Developments along the Border:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Railway Line:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>China has started the first bullet train line in Tibet, linking <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/chinas-railway-near-arunachal-border\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Lhasa to Nyingchi</strong></a> near the border with Arunachal Pradesh.</li>\n<li>It is the second major rail link to Tibet after the <strong>Qinghai-Tibet railway that opened in 2006.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Highway:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>In 2021, China completed construction of a <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/china-s-new-strategic-highway\" rel=\"noopener\"

India.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>New Villages:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>In January 2021</strong>, there were reports of <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/china-s-new-villages-in-arunachal-pradesh#:~:text=Key%20Points,of%20Actual%20Control%20(LAC).\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Chinese construction of three villages</strong></a> in Arunachal Pradesh 5 kilometres from the Bum La pass.</li>\n<li>In 2020, satellite images emerged showing a new village called Pangda built 2-3 km into what Bhutan sees as its land.</li>\n<li>In 2017, the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) government launched a plan to build moderately well-off villages in border areas.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Under this plan <strong>628 first line and second line villages</strong>\u2014referring to those right on the border and others in remote areas slightly further within\u2014would be

style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Strategic Location:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Such development in view of the strategic location of Chumbi Valley creates a concern for India.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Chumbi Valley</strong> is a 100-km protrusion of Chinese territory located between Bhutan in the east and Sikkim in the west.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>valley\u2019s location has long resulted in concerns</strong> that it could be <strong>used to launch operations</strong> to snap strategic communications links in the Siliguri Corridor.<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>Siliguri Corridor</strong> is a narrow stretch of land located around the city of Siliguri in West Bengal. <strong>It connects northeastern states with the rest of the country</strong>, and is also known as <strong>chicken's neck.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>China\u2019s Strengthening Position:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>These developments have come against the backdrop of the<a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/galwan-valley-clash\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong> border standoff</strong></a> that began in May 2020 and a <strong>rapid build-up of infrastructure on the Chinese side</strong> along the LAC, including airports, helipads, missile facilities and air sites.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Steps Taken by India to Strengthen its Border:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>India has its own <strong>High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS)</strong> in Gulmarg, Jammu and Kashmir.</li>\n<li>India will spend <strong>10% funds</strong> of the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/boosting-infrastructure-along-china-border\" rel=\"noopener\"

Arunachal Pradesh</strong> will shorten travel time for troops till the LAC through Tawang, which China claims to be its territory.</li>\n<li>A<strong> tunnel</strong> is being constructed under the <strong>Se La pass in Arunachal Pradesh</strong> which connects Tawang to the rest of Arunachal and Guwahati.</li>\n<li>The state government of Arunachal Pradesh has advocated <a

News</h3>\n<p>Recently, the <strong>Minister of State for New &amp; Renewable Energy</strong> launched <strong>\u2018The India Story\u2019 booklet</strong>, a compilation of I<strong>ndian initiatives that are shaping India\u2019s energy transition.</strong></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li>The booklet was launched at the event on <strong>Accelerating Citizen Centric Energy Transition</strong> organized by the <strong>Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE).</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>It was organized in collaboration with the <strong>Permanent Mission of India (PMI)</strong> to the <a href=\"/important-institutions/drishti-specials-important-institutions-international-institution/united-nations-1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>United Nations</strong></a> and the <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/extreme-climate-events-ceew\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW).</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Minister also <strong>launched a website</strong> which will act as a <strong>repository of energy transition related knowledge resources from around the world.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Points</h3>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: square;\">\n<li><strong>Growth of Renewable Sector:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>In the last 6 years, <strong>India\u2019s installed Renewable Energy (RE)</strong> capacity has <strong>increased by over two and a half times</strong> and stands at more than <strong>141 Giga Watts</strong> (including large Hydro).<br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>It is about <strong>37% of the country\u2019s total capacity.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The installed <strong>solar energy capacity has increased by over 15 times</strong>, and stands at <strong>41.09 GW.</strong></li>\n<li>India\u2019s RE capacity is the <strong>4<sup>th</sup> largest in the world.</strong> Its <strong>annual RE addition has been exceeding that of coal based thermal power since 2017.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Ease of Investment in Renewables:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>During the last 7 years, over <strong>USD 70 billion investment has been made in RE in India.</strong></li>\n<li>India has a very <strong>liberal foreign investment policy for renewables allowing 100% <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-analysis/fdi-inflow\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)</a> through the automatic route</strong> in the sector.<br/>\n<ul

business</strong></a> is India\u2019s utmost priority.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Established dedicated <strong>Project Development Cells (PDC)</strong> and <strong>FDI</strong> cells in all Ministries for handholding and facilitating domestic and foreign investors. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>PDCs have been established for the development of investible projects in coordination between the Central Government and State Governments and thereby grow the pipeline of investible projects in India and in turn increase FDI inflows.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Renewable Energy Investment Promotion and Facilitation Board (REIPFB) Portal:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>It has been developed to provide <strong>one-stop assistance and facilitation to the Industry and Investors</strong> for development of projects and bringing new investment to the RE sector in India.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Industry\u2019s Commitment:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Several members from the Industry have voluntarily declared RE goals and committed to the <strong>Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)</strong>, Renewable 100% (RE100) and <strong>Science based targets (SBTs).</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li><strong>CDP</strong> is a <strong>global disclosure system</strong> that enables companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts.</li>\n<li><strong>SBTs</strong> are <strong>greenhouse gas</strong> reduction goals set by businesses.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Green Tariff:</strong><br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Rules are being framed for a <strong>'green tariff' policy</strong> that will help electricity <a href=\"/daily-updates/daily-news-editorials/ujwal-discom-assurance-yojana\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Distribution Companies (Discoms)</strong> </a>supply electricity generated from clean energy projects at a cheaper rate as compared to power from conventional fuel sources. <br/>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type:
