Unscientific mining practices adopted by some of them and poor working conditions of labour in some of the private coal mines became matters of concern for the Government. On account of these reasons, the Central Government took a decision to nationalise the private coal mines. <strong>The nationalisation was done in two phases, the first with the coking coal mines in 1971-72 and then with the non-coking coal mines in 1973.</strong></li><li>Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister of the country from 1971-1973. <strong>Statement 1 is correct.</strong></li><li>Statement 2 is not correct- After the Supreme Court cancelled the coal block allocations in 2014.</li><li>To manage and reallocate the cancelled blocks in a <strong>transparent and accountable manner, the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 was enacted.</strong> Enabling provisions were made in the above said Act for<strong> \u2018allocation of coal mines by way of auction</strong> and allotment for the sale of coal.\u2019</li><li>In a recent notification by the Government on 20th February, the government opened up commercial coal mining for the private sector on February 20, and approved the <strong>methodology for auction of coal mines / blocks for sale of coal.</strong></li><li>There will be an <strong>\u2018ascending forward auction\u2019</strong> -- a two-stage online auction comprising (i) technical bid and (ii) financial bid with initial and final price offers. The bid parameter will be the price offer in \u20b9/tonne which will be paid to the State government on the actual production of coal.</li><li><strong>Statement 3 is not correct-</strong> India is still one of the largest importer of Coal. Domestic coal has been able to meet only 75% of our annual coal demand. The shortfall in local coal availability is met through imports of around 200 mt.</li></ul>"

Near-infrared radiation is being used to detect healthy vegetation in agriculture. Healthy vegetation reflects green light and absorbs red and blue light. The green light that our eyes see is chlorophyll created by plants during photosynthesis. <strong>Chlorophyll will reflect more light in the green and near infrared spectrum compared to other wavelengths.</strong> This is why near infrared radiation in combination with NDVI is one of the primary remote sensing applications in agriculture and the environment.</li><li>Remote sensing from satellites can deliver information on <strong>GHG soil emissions by estimating tropospherical, near-surface CO2 and CH4 concentrations</strong> based on the measurement of the intensity of the reflected sunlight in small wavelength bands in the visible and short-wavelength IR portion of the spectrum.</li></ul>"

      "explanation": "<ul><li><strong>Statement 1 is correct:</strong> Methane hydrate is a crystalline solid that consists of a methane molecule surrounded by a cage of interlocking water molecules (see image at the top of this page). Methane hydrate is an \"ice\" that only occurs naturally in subsurface deposits where temperature and pressure conditions are favorable for its formation. Owing to melting of ice, global warming might trigger the release of methane gas from these deposits.</li><li><strong>Statement 2 is correct:</strong> Four Earth environments have the temperature and pressure conditions suitable for the formation and stability of methane hydrate. These are: 1) sediment and sedimentary rock units below Arctic permafrost; 2) sedimentary deposits along continental margins; 3) deep-water sediments of inland lakes and seas; and, 4) under Antarctic ice.</li><li><strong>Statement 3 is correct:</strong> Methane is relatively short-lived in the atmosphere; a molecule of methane is oxidized to water and carbon dioxide after a decade or so, mainly by reaction with another trace gas, the hydroxyl radical OH-. Thus, unlike the case of carbon dioxide (which stays in the atmosphere longer than methane), a concerted effort to reduce methane emissions would have almost immediate results in terms of reduction of greenhouse effect.&nbsp;</li></ul>"
